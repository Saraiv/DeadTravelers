# DeadTravelers
 
Welcome to the DeadTravelers experience - a whimsical tale of time-traveling skeletons 
set in the peculiar town of Bonemarrow Hollow.

## Overview

Once upon a time, in the peculiar town of Bonemarrow Hollow, lived Nicolai, affectionately known as Nico, 
a grumpy yet humorously inclined skeleton. Nico's tranquil existence took an unexpected 
turn when a chance encounter with Magui and her excitable dog, Celinhos, led them to a mysterious 
portal in the town's park.

## Journey Begins!

As Nico and Magui touched Celinho's fur, an inexplicable energy 
transported them to an alternative reality. They found themselves amidst swirling colors 
and lights, realizing that they had stumbled upon a portal capable of transporting them through time.

## A Glimpse of the Old West

Their first destination was the Wild West, where Nico begrudgingly donned 
a weathered cowboy hat and a tattered poncho. Magui, on the other hand, transformed into a 
stunning lady in a gorgeous dress, ready for the adventure that awaited them 
in the sun-soaked landscapes of the Old West.
